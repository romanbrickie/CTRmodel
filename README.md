# CTRmodel
CTR prediction model based on pure Spark MLlib, no third-party library.

# Realized Models
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* Factorization Machine
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
* GBDT + LR
* Neural Network
* Inner Product Neural Network (IPNN)
* Outer Product Neural Network (OPNN)

# Usage
It's a maven project. Spark version is 2.3.0. Scala version is 2.11. <br />
After dependencies are imported by maven automatically, you can simple run the example function (**com.ggstar.example.ModelSelection**) to train all the CTR models and get the metrics comparison among all the models.
